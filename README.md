# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose
Use the information learned in Module 5 to create a calendar application so someone can add important events to a daily planner. 

## Acceptance Criteria
- current date and time is displayed at the top of the calendar
- there are time blocks for standard business hours (I chose 7AM - 6PM)
- each time block is color-coded based on whether it's in the past, present, or future
- ability to type an event into a time-block and it persists through local storage when you save it

## How to Use
Click on a time-box and start typing the task you need to complete during that hour. Press the save icon on the right-hand side to save that task.
